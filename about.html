    <h1>Lavish Loe</h1>
    <p>Growing up in an abusive household smack dab in the middle of an impoverished neighborhood,
    "Lavish Loe" took to writing raps and poetry as an outlet for her inner most thoughts.</p>  
    <p>Listening to classic tracks from Micheal Jackson to Jay Z , Jadakiss to Lauren Hill, 
        she would tune out the sorrows at  home, while also making up her own melodies and metaphors.</p> 
    <p>Lavish Loe was inspired by these wordsmith(s) where she herself knew that one day her music could become therapy for someone else as it did for her and it will.</p> 
    
    <p>By the age of 10, Loe released her very first music video, that’s when she fell in love with the craft of music making.
                                            "Intellectual, Entrepreneur, Visionary and A Big Shark."</p>

        Becoming a veteran of the roller coaster we call life, 
        Lavish Loe has a unique story to tell.</p> 
            
    <p>"When I sit back and reflect I am just glad I was able to make my mother proud.</p> 
    <p>Proving she raised me right and its worth. 
        It’s like my education and my music are my greatest accomplishments."</p>
